Imagine an Operating Environment designed from the ground up to be small, fast, responsive, and radically simple.  Not just simple in its function, also simple to program for and to use.  This is the design goal of YASDOE, which to date has been a single person project over the last 10 years, starting in June of 2012 and finally being released to the world starting in May of 2022 (with some things ahead of this).
