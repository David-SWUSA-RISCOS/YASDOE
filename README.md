PLEASE SEE: [The YASDOE Documents](./docs/README.md) For more information.

**NOTE:**
I have been rewriting small parts of YASDOE in a compiled subset of BASIC V as appropriate while documenting the function.

YASDOE is going to be primarily hosted on another site.  I may end up uploading the archives here as well, though that is to be seen, there are difficulties with using git for files that are typed in nature, and some of which have multiple forks.  Most of the documentation takes advantage of forked files, using the resource fork for formatting information (in a format that is viewable in the **ED** program in YASDOE as well as in **Teach** on GS/OS.

I will continue to convert some parts of the documentation to markdown for viewing here, though this will only be small parts of the documentation.
