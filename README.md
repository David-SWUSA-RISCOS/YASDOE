YASDOE (Yet Another Simple Desktop Operating Environment) a Simple  680x0 Operating System, in three versions.

There is some consideration being given to a future PowerPC layer, though this is unlikely to be seen in the near future.

YASDOE as it was known has been canceled.  There will be continuing updates, though in the future only for 680x0 and PowerPC based computers.

For the time beings this repository is just a placeholder for that which is to come, a different direction.   This is do to dissagreeing with the direction that ARM is taking there new ISA.  As such no more ARM based work.

The future direction will be based on much of the existing code of YASDOE.  Specifically there will end up being two components of YASDOE, a ROM that is able to boot both YASDOE and Macintosh System Software and thus provides the needed toolsets, and the disk based system software intended to be compatible with the same.
