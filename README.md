# YASDOE
YASDOE a Simple ARM and 680x0 Operating System

YASDOE stands for Yet Another Simple Desktop Operating Environment.

Designed to be an easy to understand, easy to use, easy to program for, small Preemptive Multitasking, Protected Memory, Microkernel based Operating System with a very responsive Windowing System and simple CLI, YASDOE is a personal pasion of a project.  Starting in 2012 YASDOE began to take form as I learned to program for a then new ARM based computer on the bare metal.  Over the last 10 years YASDOE has become a usable Operating System, that I am ready to share with the world.

TODO:  This readme will be updated to give better information, this version is just for the creation of this Repo.
