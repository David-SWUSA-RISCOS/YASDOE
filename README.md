YASDOE (Yet Another Simple Desktop Operating Environment) a Simple  680x0 Operating System, decended from GraFaDOE.

There is some consideration being given to a future PowerPC layer, though this is unlikely to be seen in the near future.

Imagine an Operating Environment designed from the ground up to be small, fast, responsive, and radically simple.  Not just simple in its function, also simple to program for and to use.  At its core it is a Macintosh System Software Clone written from the ground up by one person as a side project over 10 years in responce to the descusions around the Raspberry Pi SBC in 2012 / 2013.

Note:  Until enough is up to have a fully documented OS, I have decided to use the Web Interface to update the github repo.  And I will continue to use the web interface as the github repo is by need documentation only (do to the lack of support for Resource Forks).   I am looking for a means to host the source and binaries of YASDOE as archive files, as not being able to view the source is antithis to the nature of github (and some source files have a resource fork (ok a lot of source files have a resource fork).
