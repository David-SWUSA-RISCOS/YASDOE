# User Documentation.

This is the index page for user documentation for YASDOE.  Here you will find information about using YASDOE as well as the applications included with YASDEOE.

While YASDOE is largely inspired by RISC OS, with some inspiration from ProDOS and GS/OS, YASDOE is a CLI only Operating Environment.  The CLI is modeled after that of TOS COMMAND.PRG (as distrubited by Atari), and the shell interpreter is named COMMAND.PRG to highlight the source of inspiration.  Volumes are assigned a name, a FS+Voume (RISC OS style) and a drive letter, thus making it possible to use any of these identifiers for accessing Drives (With A: and B: being assigned to the first two Floppy disks or equilivent).
