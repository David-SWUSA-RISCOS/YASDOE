# User Documentation.

This is the index page for user documentation for YASDOE.  Here you will find information about using YASDOE as well as the applications included with YASDEOE.

While YASDOE is largely inspired by RISC OS, with some inspiration from ProDOS and GS/OS, YASDOE is a CLI only Operating Environment.  The CLI is modeled after that of TOS COMMAND.PRG (as distrubited by Atari), and the shell interpreter is named COMMAND.PRG to highlight the source of inspiration.  Volumes are assigned a name, a FS+Voume (RISC OS style) and a drive letter, thus making it possible to use any of these identifiers for accessing Drives (With A: and B: being assigned to the first two Floppy disks or equilivent).

## THANK YOU:

<s>I noticed that the download count of the YASDOE binaries and Documentation is over 400 downloads on the main file site for YASDOE</s>.  Thank you to everyone that is giving YASDOE a try.

Now two days after posting the files we are well over 500 downloads of the binaries, as well as nearly 700 of the source archive and documentation archive.  Thank you all for all that are using or modifiying YASDOE.  Have fun with it, I hope someone does something useful with this OS.
