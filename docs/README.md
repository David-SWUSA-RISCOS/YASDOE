# YASDOE Documentation:

**YASDOE** (**Y**et **A**nother **S**imple **D**esktop **O**perating **E**nvironment) is a simple ARM and M68K Operating system that is heavily influenced by RISC OS.

Some new features in YASDOE include the use of regions, support for resource forks instead of application dirrectories (application directories are still supported), and some other small things to improve the user experience.  YASDOE also provides an alternative library based calling mechinism to improve on some system call responce times.
